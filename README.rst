Moo ?
=====

This is the content of a talk given to Montreal Python 32, Oct 22nd
2012, and to PyCon Canada 2012 in Toronto, on November 11th 2012.

What you'll find where
----------------------

``Moo/`` is the pyramid code base, the primary thing I coded during
the presentation.  It's there, untouched.

``clikable/`` is the little app with stupid jokes to let people input
data.

``slides/`` is my slides deck, with a demo of ``gevent-socketio``
integration with ``bottle.py``.

``vendor/`` is where I have downloaded version of the different
libraries I integrate in the presentation.. just so I don't need to
download them from the web while presenting.

``prez/`` is where I decided to store my PRESENTATION.html, which
isn't an html file, which is what I had printed beside the computer
while doing the presentation.
