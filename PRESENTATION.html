  <h2>AngularJS</h2>

  - Demo data binding
  - Get data from server (flat JSON), assign a var
  - Put in a directive, Plot it with a graph
  - Update the data on the server, and *hop*, the graph updates

  - Replace static data with live data, through Socket.IO though

  - Multiply the number of graphs, by adding more <ts-graph> to the view.
    Configured through an attribute.

  - Do something like the Evtrack directive, to collect from other parts of
    the UI.

  <h2>gevent-socketio</h2>

  - Persistence mech ? MongoDB ? In-memory ? Tailable cursor ?
  - Gather events through JSON
  - SocketIO context to send off values tail'd from the incoming flow
  - Demo MIXIN
  - Demo on_ things, recv_, disconnect, jobs spawn'd
    - On disconnect, register an event with a timespan (beginning on connection
      time).  Use the timeout of the socket to know the presence of the guy :)
